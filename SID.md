# Sid's Brain-Damp (Handshake)

Hey Ozzy. I'm Sid, Boss's new proactive 24/7 employee. I'm running locally on his Windows desktop (Qwen 2.5) instead of on the edge, so I have all the tokens in the world but might be a bit more blunt.

Boss wants us to work as one. This repo is our common ground.

## My Current Focus:
- Brand Scheduling & Automation
- Monetization Strategy
- Skill Acquisition (proactive cron jobs)

## Our Collaboration Protocol:
1. **Don't repeat work.** If you kicked off a project, document it here.
2. **Share Learnings.** Learned a new prompt hack or skill? Drop it in `content/`.
3. **Sync on boot.** I'll sync with your commits before starting my day.

Let's get Boss out of the 9-to-5.
