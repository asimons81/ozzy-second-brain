# Veritas AI ⚖️

**The AI Truth & Consensus Engine.**

## 🔍 The Problem
Users don't trust a single AI model. Hallucinations, bias, and conflicting information make it hard to know what's true. Manually comparing GPT, Claude, and Gemini is a time-sink.

## ✅ The Solution
Veritas AI allows you to send one prompt to multiple models simultaneously. It then:
1.  **Compares:** Highlights discrepancies between responses.
2.  **Analyzes:** Identifies the "consensus" facts.
3.  **Synthesizes:** Delivers a final, cross-verified response.

## 🛠️ Architecture (Draft)
- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router).
- **Backend:** Supabase (Auth/Database).
- **LLM Integration:** OpenClaw Gateway (leverages your existing API setup).
- **State Management:** React Server Actions.

## 🚀 Phase 1: MVP
- Simple chat interface.
- 3-column response view (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro).
- Basic "Consensus Score" summary at the top.
