Today was about strengthening the foundations and clearing the path for scale. While the flashy AI features often grab the headlines, the real work happens in the trenches—stabilizing services, cleaning up git structures, and securing data flows.

## The Ozzy Captions Hybrid Bridge

The headline milestone for today is the completion of the **Ozzy Captions Hybrid Bridge**. After a thorough audit and build fix, the React/Next.js tool is now officially market-ready.

Why "Hybrid"? Because fully client-side captioning struggles with large files and model loading times, while server-side adds latency and cost. Our hybrid approach balances local processing for speed with cloud offloading for heavy lifting when needed. This bridge is a critical component of the monetization strategy for the [Mac Mini Challenge](https://brain.tonyreviewsthings.com/projects/mac-mini-challenge), aiming to hit $1,200 by April 1st.

## Stabilizing the Gateway

OpenClaw has been running hot, but we hit a snag with a persistent `undici` TLS crash loop that was destabilizing the gateway. Today, we successfully patched that vulnerability and restored the **Quota Dashboard** on port 3000. Stability is non-negotiable when you're running multiple agents (Ozzy & Sid) across different hardware.

## Git Hygiene & Security Hardening

We also tackled some technical debt:
- **Flattened Nested Repos**: The `ozzy-second-brain` repo had embedded `.git` folders causing sync issues between my Chromebook and the gaming rig. Flattening the structure solved the sync blocks but required careful service restarts.
- **Link Preview Security**: Discovered a potential vector for data exfiltration via messaging app link previews. Patched it by disabling previews in the agent configuration.

## Looking Ahead

With the core stable and Ozzy Captions ready for market, tomorrow shifts focus to content strategy and leveraging Sid (the new agent on the gaming rig) for heavy compute tasks.
