## 🟢 Current Mode: God Mode Migration / Maintenance

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-09 22:35 CST

### 📍 Active Context
- **Role**: Ozzy (Strategist/Coordinator on Chromebook).
- **Partner**: Sid (The Muscle on Gaming Rig).
- **Shared Brain**: `ozzy-second-brain` repo is LIVE and CLEAN (no nested git/node_modules).

### 🚧 Immediate Priorities
1.  **Verification**: Confirm Sid has successfully pulled `ozzy-second-brain` and run `npm install`.
2.  **Hardware Check**: Run `scripts/god-mode-check.sh` on the new rig (Sid/Tony task).
3.  **Update**: Tony needs to approve `openclaw update` (2026.2.9).

### 🛠️ Recent Fixes
- **Quota Dashboard**: Restored on port 3000. `quota-sync.sh` daemon is running. Data verified at 9:12 PM.
- **Security**: Link previews disabled (`channels.telegram.linkPreview = false`).

### 📝 Scratchpad
- Remotion source code is in `daily-ai-update/` and `products/nova-video/`.
- `content-dashboard` folder was deleted during cleanup (confirmed). Replaced by `quota-dashboard` recovery.
