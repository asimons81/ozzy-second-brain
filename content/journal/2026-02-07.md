# Daily Note - 2026-02-07

## 🔧 Infrastructure & Stability
- **Gateway Crash Loop Resolved**: Diagnosed and fixed `undici` TLS crash (`TypeError` on `setSession`). Re-linked `openclaw-gateway.service` to the correct `pnpm` binary path.
- **Browser Relay Fix**: Relocated extension files to `~/OpenClawExtension` to bypass ChromeOS file picker visibility issues. Extension is now successfully attached to X.
- **Gemini 3 Flash**: Successfully migrated to the latest flash model for main agent turns. Quota tracking confirmed active.

## 🎬 NOVA Hiring & First Pitch
- **Hiring Complete**: Formally "hired" NOVA (Video Production Agent) via an isolated sub-agent.
- **Mission**: Move beyond generic video renders. Mandated a Cyber-Industrial aesthetic (OLED Black & Neon Teal) and technical HUD visuals.
- **First Pitch**: NOVA delivered a 25s vertical video concept for "LocalGPT in Rust," featuring a "Digital Awakening" scroll-stopper. Breakdown saved to `clawd/hires/nova-pitch.md`.

## 🚀 SmugMug Migration (Operation Portfolio Rescue)
- **Problem**: Original Windows GUI app was failing on large library scans and SmugMug's inconsistent JSON responses.
- **Solution**: Developed a headless CLI migrator (`src/cli.py`) in `smugmug-google-photos-sync`.
- **Status**: Active and stable on the `penguin` host (PID 9541). Successfully synced **1,086 / 3,500+** photos so far.

## 🛠️ X-Amplify v2 Polishing
- **Build Fix**: Resolved Vercel build failures by fixing TypeScript 'never' types in API routes.
- **Model Bump**: Switched generation engine to `gemini-3-flash-preview`.

## 🌙 Night Shift (Ozzy)
- **Automated Trend Sniping**: Created `tools/trend_sniper_auto.py` to bridge Hacker News trending topics with the X-Amplify generation engine.
- **Content Generation**: Successfully processed top AI/Agent stories and generated 30 viral post formats (10 per story).
- **Morning Brief**: Generated `morning-brief-2026-02-07.md` with ideas ready for morning review.

## 🔬 Research & Strategy
- **Henry Autonomy**: Sub-agent research into persistent local bridge patterns.
- **Vadim Pivot**: Researching Vadim Strizheus's "get serious" agentic marketing blueprint.

## 💡 Lessons Learned
- **AI Consultation > AI Directive**: Claude built a beautiful but broken Windows app; Ozzy (agent) proposed a simpler CLI that actually worked.
- **Local Bridge Leverage**: Offloading heavy sync tasks to the local Mac Mini (`penguin`) avoids Vercel timeouts and expensive API costs.

## 📝 TODOs
- [ ] Review NOVA's LocalGPT script and approve first render.
- [ ] Verify SmugMug migration completion tomorrow morning (4-6 hours remaining).
- [ ] Review Vadim research summary once the sub-agent completes.
- [ ] Tony: Refresh Anthropic token with `user:profile` scope to restore usage stats.
