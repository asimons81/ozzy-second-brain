# Daily Note - 2026-02-07 (Update)

## 🔧 Infrastructure & Stability
- **Gateway Crash Loop Resolved**: Diagnosed `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'setSession')` in `undici` relating to TLS handshakes.
- **Service Re-link**: Discovered the `openclaw-gateway.service` was pointing to an old install path. Reinstalled the gateway service using the correct `pnpm` binary (v2026.2.6-3).
- **Relay Issues**: Browser Relay (Chrome) remains a frequent bottleneck for automated trend sniping/browser tasks; manually paged user to attach tab.

## 🚀 X-Amplify (v2) Project Status
- **Codebase Audit**: Confirmed `products/x-amplify-v2` is feature-complete for MVP.
- **Features Verified**:
    - **Amplify Protocol**: Core generation via Gemini 2.0 Flash.
    - **YouTube Mining**: Transcript extraction logic active.
    - **Viral Heatmap**: Hybrid AI/Heuristic scoring engine implemented.
    - **Persona System**: Tone of voice cloning/storage verified.
- **UI Refresh**: Polished the landing page (`src/app/page.tsx`) with high-contrast "Cyber-Industrial" branding.
- **Deployment**: Ready for subdomain pointing to `amplify.tonyreviewsthings.com`.

## 📝 TODOs
- [ ] Point `amplify.tonyreviewsthings.com` to the Vercel deployment.
- [ ] Implement Phase 7 (Stripe Billing) and Phase 8 (Direct-to-X Publishing) for X-Amplify.
- [ ] Monitor Gateway stability over the next 24 hours to ensure the `undici` crash doesn't return.
