# Daily Note - 2026-02-07

## 🔧 Infrastructure & Stability
- **Gateway Crash Loop Resolved**: Diagnosed and fixed `undici` TLS crash (`TypeError` on `setSession`). Re-linked `openclaw-gateway.service` to the correct `pnpm` binary path.
- **Extension Recovery**: Provided clear instructions for the user to re-install the Browser Relay extension after it disappeared.
- **Gemini 3 Flash**: Successfully migrated to the latest flash model for main agent turns.

## 🚀 SmugMug Migration (Operation Portfolio Rescue)
- **Problem**: Original Windows GUI app was failing on large library scans and SmugMug's inconsistent JSON responses.
- **Solution**: Developed a headless CLI migrator (`src/cli.py`) in `smugmug-google-photos-sync`.
- **Fixes**: Patched SmugMug client to handle stringified JSON blobs in photo metadata.
- **Status**: Migration of ~3,500 photos is currently active on the `penguin` host.

## 🛠️ X-Amplify v2 Polishing
- **Build Fix**: Resolved Vercel build failures by fixing TypeScript 'never' types in API routes.
- **Model Bump**: Switched generation engine to `gemini-3-flash-preview`.

## 📊 Quota Dashboard Evolution
- **Whitelist Update**: Updated `scanner.py` with Tony's full model roster (Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.6, etc.).
- **Live Status**: Quota tracking for Gemini 3 Flash is confirmed active.

## 🔬 Research & Strategy
- **Henry Autonomy**: Sub-agent research into persistent local bridge patterns.
- **Vadim Pivot**: Researching Vadim Strizheus's "get serious" agentic marketing blueprint.

## 💡 Lessons Learned
- **AI Consultation > AI Directive**: Claude built a beautiful but broken Windows app; Ozzy (agent) proposed a simpler CLI that actually worked.
- **Local Bridge Leverage**: Offloading heavy sync tasks to the local Mac Mini (`penguin`) avoids Vercel timeouts and expensive API costs.

## 🌙 Night Shift (Ozzy)
- **Automated Trend Sniping**: Created `tools/trend_sniper_auto.py` to bridge Hacker News trending topics with the X-Amplify generation engine.
- **Content Generation**: Successfully processed top AI/Agent stories and generated 30 viral post formats (10 per story).
- **Renders Update**: Renders and Ideas are now automatically saved to the Second Brain for morning review.
- **Migration Watch**: Confirmed SmugMug migration (Operation Portfolio Rescue) is still active on `penguin` host (PID 9541).
- **Infrastructure Fix**: Identified "Anthropic 403 Forbidden" error as a scope requirement issue (`user:profile`). Tony needs to refresh the token with proper scopes.

## 📝 TODOs
- [ ] Verify SmugMug migration completion tomorrow morning.
- [ ] Review Vadim research summary once the sub-agent completes.
- [ ] Tony: Refresh Anthropic token with `user:profile` scope to restore usage stats.
