# Daily Note - 2026-02-07

## 🔧 Self-Healing & Maintenance
- **Resolved Git Sync Collision**: Fixed a divergence in `quota-dashboard/` repo. 
- **Infrastructure Stability**: Noticed recurring Gateway crashes (Node.js `TypeError` in `undici` relating to `setSession`). Gateway auto-restarts within seconds, but this instability caused the 06:00 AM Morning Brief cron to be missed.
- **Anthropic Auth Issue**: Spotted `HTTP 403: OAuth token does not meet scope requirement user:profile` for the Anthropic provider. This prevents accurate usage tracking for that pool.

## 📊 Process Updates
- **Second Brain → Command Center**: Unified all documentation and outputs into `brain.tonyreviewsthings.com`.
  - Rebuilt homepage as a tile-based launchpad with a "Recent Activity" feed.
  - Implemented Global Command Palette (Ctrl/⌘ K) for instant navigation.
  - Enabled visual video rendering in Markdown (`rehype-raw`).
  - Synced Morning Briefs, Daily Journals, and Video Renders (`renders/*.mp4`) to the site.
  - Applied "Obsidian Teal" elevated industrial design system (OLED black, steel surfaces, neon teal glows).
- **Quota Dashboard Expansion**: Added full requested model roster (GPT 5.2, Codex, Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.5/4.6, Gemini 3 Flash/Pro, Image Gen). Separated usage bars by provider (Anthropic vs Antigravity).
- **X Trend Sniping**: Switched hourly scouting from Hacker News to X. Currently blocked due to missing browser relay attachment (requires an attached Chrome tab).
- **Morning Brief Readiness**: Manually triggered the morning brief at 06:16 AM CST. Now automatically synced to the Second Brain.
- **Quota Tracker Permanent Line**: Migrated to `systemd` user service (`quota-sync.service`).

## 📝 TODOs
- [ ] Investigate moving the Workspace Archive to a separate GitHub repository to avoid cluttering the `quota-dashboard` repo.
- [ ] Fix Gateway `undici` TLS crashes (TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'setSession')).
- [ ] Refresh Anthropic OAuth token with `user:profile` scope.
- [ ] Re-attach Browser Relay (Chrome tab) to enable X Trend Sniping.
- [ ] Implement "Operations-First" top-level routes for Briefs/Renders in Second Brain (flattening from `/docs/*`).
