# Memory for 2026-02-09

## Night Shift (11:00 PM)
- **Task**: Automate Ozzy Captions Content Workflow
- **Selected**: Headless Content Generator & Launch Kit
- **Impact**: Enables automated content creation for Ozzy Captions, directly impacting marketing for the "market-ready" product.
- **Execution**:
  1. Created `x-amplify/headless.py` for CLI content generation.
  2. Generated 10 high-signal tweets for Ozzy Captions launch (`products/ozzy-captions/generated-content-v2.json`).
  3. Documented usage in `products/ozzy-captions/launch-kit.md`.
  4. Verified with test inputs.

## 🎁 Proactive Work
- **Heartbeat Check (4:56 PM)**:
  - Identified OpenClaw update (2026.2.9) available.
  - Security audit flagged `plugins.allow` setting missing.
  - Researching GPU acceleration for `faster-whisper` (Ozzy Captions).
- **Trend Scout (6:01 PM)**:
  - **LocalGPT (Rust)**: High-performance, local-first AI assistant in Rust. Perfect candidate for Sid's backend.
  - **Opus 4.5 "Thinking"**: Reports of radically different agent behavior. Validates Claude Pro investment.
  - **Windows 11 Background Agent**: Native OS-level agent rollout. Need to benchmark against our custom setup.
- **Trend Scout (9:01 PM)**:
  - **Voxtral Mini 4B**: Rust + WASM + WebGPU realtime model running in browser.
  - **Security Advisory**: Data exfiltration vulnerability via messaging app "link previews."
  - **More-Compute**: Lightweight, git-friendly local interactive notebook environment.

## 🔧 Infrastructure & Stability
- **Updates**: OpenClaw update available. Tony needs to approve `openclaw update`.
- **Security**: 
  - Set `plugins.allow` in config to harden environment.
  - implemented security patch for Link Preview exploit (`channels.telegram.linkPreview = false`).
- **Quota Crisis**: Background tasks hit 429 API wall. Reset expected around 7:20 PM CST.
- **CRISIS RESOLVED: Quota Dashboard**: Restored on port 3000. `quota-sync.sh` daemon restarted. Fixed issue caused by "Brain Surgery" (nested `.git` cleanup killing local server).
- **Brain Surgery**: Successful git rebase to unify Ozzy and Sid's memories. Resolved nested repo issues.
- **Source Sync**: Identified and fixed "Missing Source Code" issue in Shared Brain. Removed `node_modules` from git index and pushed Remotion project files (`daily-ai-update/` and `products/nova-video/`) to the repo.

## 🚀 The Migration (God Mode)
- **Status**: Migration of Ozzy to Gaming Rig **FAILED**.
- **Pivot**: New agent **"Sid"** instantiated on the Gaming Rig (The Muscle).
- **Collaboration**: GitHub repo (`ozzy-second-brain`) established as the "Shared Brain" for Ozzy and Sid. Folder structure unified under `content/journal/`.
- **Team Dynamics**: Ozzy remains the Strategist/Coordinator on Chromebook; Sid handles heavy compute and local 8B+ LLMs.
- **Protocol**: Established "Job Ticket" system. Ozzy will leave tasks for Sid in `notes/sid-queue/`.
- **Handshake**: Handled personality sync—unified Mission/Soul, distinct Identities.

## 📝 TODOs
- [ ] Tony: Approve `openclaw update`.
- [ ] Tony/Sid: Run `scripts/god-mode-check.sh` on the new rig.
- [ ] Ozzy: Research high-ticket marketing "bridge" strategies (Vick Strizheus).
- [ ] Ozzy: Draft "GPU Optimization Guide" for the new rig.
- [ ] Ozzy: Populate `notes/sid-queue/` with first collaborative tickets.

## Morning Brief Instructions
- Include the "Ozzy Captions Launch Kit" in the briefing.
- Highlight the new "Headless Content Generator" tool (`x-amplify/headless.py`) as a key automation win.
