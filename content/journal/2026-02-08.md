# Daily Note - 2026-02-08

## ☀️ Morning Brief Review
- **Weather**: Clear, 25°F.
- **Top Stories**: Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.3-Codex, and Agentic C Compiler are the main highlights.
- **SmugMug Migration**: 100% complete (3,493/3,495 photos synced).

## 🎁 Proactive Work
- **Newsletter Compilation**: Compiled Issue #2 of "THE TOOL TAKEDOWN".
- **LinkedIn Drafting**: Created a draft at `second-brain/content/renders/linkedin-localgpt.md` based on today's LocalGPT trend.
- **Cleanup**: Removed failed 0-byte research file and session for "Vadim" (Corrected to Vick) Strizheus.

## 🔧 Infrastructure & Stability
- **Brave Search Fix**: Resolved dependency errors (`@mozilla/readability`, `jsdom`, etc.) in the `brave-search` skill folder. Headless search is now functional.
- **Quota Sync Debug**: Identified that `quota-sync.service` fails to stay active because it is configured as `Type=simple` but runs a one-shot script (`scanner.py`). Recommended fix: Change to `Type=oneshot` or rely on the cron-triggered sync.
- **Research Pivot**: Corrected research target from "Vadim" to **Vick Strizheus** (Four Percent group) for agentic marketing strategy. Deleted failed 0-byte research artifacts.

## 📝 TODOs
- [ ] Review the new newsletter draft (Issue #2).
- [ ] Review LinkedIn post draft (`linkedin-localgpt.md`).
- [ ] Tony: Refresh Anthropic token with `user:profile` scope to restore usage tracking.
- [ ] Reconfigure `quota-sync.service` to `Type=oneshot`.
