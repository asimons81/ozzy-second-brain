# Daily Note - 2026-02-08

## ☀️ Morning Brief Review
- **Weather**: Clear, 25°F.
- **Top Stories**: Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.3-Codex, and Agentic C Compiler are the main highlights.
- **SmugMug Migration**: 100% complete (3,493/3,495 photos synced).

## 🎁 Proactive Work
- **Newsletter Compilation**: Compiled Issue #2 of "THE TOOL TAKEDOWN".
- **LinkedIn Drafting**: Created a draft at `second-brain/content/renders/linkedin-localgpt.md` based on today's LocalGPT trend.
- **Milestone**: Tony hit **500 X followers**! (Pivot from 450 earlier this morning).
- **Hacker News Milestone**: OpenClaw is trending on Hacker News (#16-20) with the story "OpenClaw is changing my life." Generated a celebration draft and triggered multiple sniper runs.
- **Technical Insight**: Drafted "World Models vs. Word Models" at `second-brain/content/renders/insight-world-vs-word-models.md` explaining why agentic infrastructure provides the grounding LLMs lack.
- **Trend Discovery**: Mitchell Hashimoto (founder of HashiCorp) just released **Vouch** on GitHub (#1 on HN). Drafted a high-signal celebration post linking it to our "Infrastructure of Trust" narrative.
- **Agentic Trends**: Captured "GitHub Agentic Workflows" and "Matchlock Sandbox" trends.

## 🔧 Infrastructure & Stability
- **Brave Search Fix**: Resolved dependency errors (`@mozilla/readability`, `jsdom`, etc.) in the `brave-search` skill folder. Headless search is now functional.
- **Quota Sync Debug**: Identified that `quota-sync.service` fails to stay active because it is configured as `Type=simple` but runs a one-shot script (`scanner.py`). **Switch completed to `Type=oneshot`**. Service now finishes cleanly and logs success.
- **Quota Sync Success (12:01 PM)**: Successfully ran the automated dashboard sync. Pushed updates to both Quota Dashboard and Second Brain repositories. 
  - Pushed 5 new files to Second Brain (including HN ideas and 500-follower celebration render).
- **Research Pivot**: Corrected research target from "Vadim" to **Vick Strizheus** (Four Percent group) for agentic marketing strategy. Deleted failed 0-byte research artifacts.
