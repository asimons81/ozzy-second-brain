- **Quota Sync Success (10:01 PM)**: Automated run completed. Dashboard updated and synced to GitHub. Usage data current. New ideas and renders synced to Second Brain. 2 files changed, 40 insertions(+).
- **Research Pivot**: Corrected research target from "Vadim" to **Vick Strizheus** (Four Percent group) for agentic marketing strategy. Deleted failed 0-byte research artifacts.

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements (4:00 PM - 4:20 PM)
**Context:** Tony requested a full audit of active projects with focus on UI/UX and feature suggestions.

### Audit Completed
- Analyzed 7 active projects: Content Dashboard, Quota Dashboard, X-Amplify, The Forge, Ozzy Captions, Second Brain, Daily AI Update
- Identified strengths: Strong visual identity (Cyber-Industrial aesthetic), consistent branding across tools
- Identified gaps: Interaction polish, feature depth, tool consolidation

### Implementations Completed

#### ✅ P0: Fix Quota Dashboard Duplicate Header
- Removed duplicate `<header>` block (lines 329-343)
- Dashboard now renders correctly

#### ✅ P1: Enhanced Drag-and-Drop (Content Dashboard)
- Added visual feedback during drag (opacity, rotation)
- Dashed outline on drop zones
- Toast notifications on successful move
- Better drop zone detection (works on columns and lists)

#### ✅ P1: Ozzy Captions Frontend Documentation
- UI already exists and is complete
- Created `README-UI.md` documenting architecture, hybrid mode, and next steps
- Identified future features: caption styling UI, timeline preview, batch processing

#### ✅ P2: Shared Design System
- Created `ozzy-design-system.css` with:
  - All color tokens, typography, spacing, shadows
  - Utility classes for buttons, cards, badges, nav, backgrounds
  - Animation keyframes (pulse, spin, slide-in)
- Created `DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` with usage guide and philosophy

#### ✅ P2: Sparkline History (Quota Dashboard)
- Added 7-day rolling history tracking to `scanner.py`
- Creates `history.json` with snapshots every 15 minutes
- Frontend renders 24-hour sparkline SVGs on each card
- Color-coded to match usage status (teal/amber/red)
- Auto-scales Y-axis for readability
- Shows "No history yet" placeholder on first run
- Full 24-hour trend visible after 96 snapshots (~24 hours)

#### ✅ P3: Command Palette (Content Dashboard)
- Added Cmd/Ctrl+K keyboard shortcut
- Modal with fuzzy search across commands and cards
- Arrow key navigation with visual selection
- Static commands: New Idea, Open tools, Jump to columns
- Dynamic search: Type 2+ chars to search card titles
- Separate `command-palette.js` file for clean architecture
- Professional glassmorphism UI

#### ✅ P3: Tool Consolidation Analysis
- Analyzed The Forge vs X-Amplify overlap
- Created comprehensive comparison document
- **Recommendation:** Merge The Forge functionality into X-Amplify as "Multi-Platform Mode"
- Rationale: Single codebase, clearer UX, builds on existing momentum
- The Forge is spec-only (not built), making merge straightforward
- Action plan documented for future implementation

### Priority List for Future Work
**P2 Remaining:**
- Add sparkline history to Quota Dashboard

**P3:**
- Evaluate The Forge vs X-Amplify merge
- Add keyboard shortcuts to Content Dashboard (Cmd+K command palette)
- Mobile PWA for idea capture

#### ✅ P3: Mobile PWA (Content Capture)
- Built standalone Progressive Web App for mobile idea capture
- Voice input via Web Speech API (tap mic, speak, auto-transcribe)
- Offline-first with Service Worker caching
- Local queue with auto-sync to Content Dashboard API (60s intervals)
- Touch-optimized UI with large tap targets
- PWA installable (Add to Home Screen on iOS/Android)
- Files: `content-capture-pwa/` (index.html, app.js, sw.js, manifest.json)
- Ready for deployment (needs icons + Vercel)

## 🚀 The Migration (God Mode)
- **Status**: Migration in progress. Tony is formatting the gaming desktop.
- **Goal**: Escape hardware constraints (6.5GB RAM) for true agentic power (8B+ models).
- **Migration Kit**: Created `ozzy_migration_kit.tar.gz` (120MB workspace backup) and `restore.sh` (one-shot rehydrator).
- **Identity Assets**: Exported `OpenClaw-key.pem` and `openclaw.json` for transfer.
- **WSL2 Optimization**: Created `notes/wslconfig_template.conf` to allocate 16GB RAM and enable GPU passthrough on the new rig.

## 🧠 Local LLM Research
- **Attempt 1**: `gemma2:2b`. Status: Deleted. Conclusion: Too weak for tool use/agency.
- **Attempt 2**: `llama3.2:3b`. Status: Installed for "shits and giggles" testing.
- **Standard**: Accepted that 8B+ models (Mistral/Llama3) are the minimum for reliable agent performance, requiring the desktop upgrade.

## 🧹 Infrastructure & Space Management
- **Disk Crisis**: Hit 100% usage (30GB).
- **Resolution**: Tony expanded container to 38GB.
- **Manual Cleanup**: Reclaimed ~3GB via `npm`, `pnpm`, and `apt` cache purging.
- **Automation**: Deployed `scripts/disk-monitor.sh` with a weekly OpenClaw cron (Sundays 3:00 AM) to auto-clean if usage > 85%.

## 🔧 Ozzy Captions (caption-this)
- **Audit**: Source code analyzed. No TODOs found in core logic.
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed frontend build failure (TypeScript `ImportMeta` error) by adding `vite-env.d.ts`.
- **Status**: `npm run build` now passes. Market-ready status: COMPLETED.



## 🔧 Infrastructure & Stability (Update 5:05 PM)
- **Content Dashboard & API Recovery**: Fixed an issue where the dashboard and API were down.
  - Port 3000 (Frontend) and 3001 (API) were locked by orphaned processes.
  - Cleared stale processes and restarted both services.
  - **API Patch**: Fixed 404 errors on API endpoints by relaxing URL matching in `index.js` (switched from `.includes()` to exact match + added HEAD request support for health checks).
  - Dashboard is now live at `content.trt`.

- **Quota Sync Success (10:16 PM)**: Automated run completed. Dashboard updated and synced to GitHub. Usage data current. New ideas and renders synced to Second Brain.
- **Quota Sync Success (10:46 PM)**: Final automated run for the night completed. Usage data synced and Second Brain (Journal) updated with "Night Shift" wrap-up. 2 files changed, 48 insertions.

## 🌙 Night Shift (Final Wrap-up)
- **Windows/WSL2 Migration (The Gaming Rig)**:
  - Deep troubleshooting session for Tony's new hardware setup.
  - Identified ASRock BIOS virtualization settings (SVM/VT-x) as the likely culprit for the 62.3% installation hang.
  - Provided a "Triple-Threat Fix" (BIOS, Terminal-based install, and Hyper-V conflict check).
  - Enhanced the migration infrastructure:
    - **`scripts/god-mode-check.sh`**: Built a benchmark tool for Tony to run on the new rig (CPU cores, RAM, GPU detection, disk speed).
    - **`restore.sh`**: Updated the recovery script to automatically handle identity files (`openclaw.json`, `OpenClaw-key.pem`).
- **Trend Sniping & Research**:
  - Captured high-impact technical trends: **Lance table format** (local vector powerhouse), **Adversarial Reasoning** (World vs Word models), and the **AI Productivity Paradox**.
  - Generated content ideas for these trends in the Second Brain.
- **Infrastructure Maintenance**:
  - Verified all cron jobs (Morning Brief, Lunch Break, Night Shift, Quota Sync) are functioning correctly.
  - Cleaned up research artifacts and optimized memory files.
