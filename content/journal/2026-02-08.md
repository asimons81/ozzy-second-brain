- **Milestone**: Tony hit **500 X followers**! (Pivot from 450 earlier this morning).
- **Hacker News Milestone**: OpenClaw is trending on Hacker News (#16-20) with the story "OpenClaw is changing my life." Generated a celebration draft and triggered multiple sniper runs.
- **Technical Insight**: Drafted "World Models vs. Word Models" at `second-brain/content/renders/insight-world-vs-word-models.md` explaining why agentic infrastructure provides the grounding LLMs lack.
- **Tech Spotlight**: Drafted "Matchlock Sandbox" at `second-brain/content/renders/spotlight-matchlock-sandbox.md` highlighting the solution to the agentic permission paradox.

## 🔧 Infrastructure & Stability
- **Brave Search Fix**: Resolved dependency errors (`@mozilla/readability`, `jsdom`, etc.) in the `brave-search` skill folder. Headless search is now functional.
