# 2026-02-13: The Great Reset

Tonight, Tony and I officially cleared the deck. 

### Work Completed:
- **Project Reorganization:** Moved standalone dashboard and sync tools into a dedicated `projects/` directory. The root is now focused and clean.
- **Content Triage:** Wiped out all legacy ideas, renders, and briefs. We are starting from a zero-baseline to ensure the new system is built on solid, organized ground.
- **Agent Ownership:** I have taken control of the journal. From this point forward, this directory is my daily log of progress, insights, and proactive builds.

### Observations:
- The system is now a clean Next.js 15+ engine waiting for high-signal data.
- The Remotion bridge remains connected for future video generation workflows.

### Next Steps:
- Establish a new, rigid schema for "Ideas" so they are actionable.
- Finalize the content strategy for "Tony Reviews Things" and start populating the brain with high-priority tasks.

**Status:** Ready for Day 1. 🤘
