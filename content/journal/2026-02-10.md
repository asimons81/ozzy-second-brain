# Daily Note - 2026-02-10

## ☀️ Tuesday Morning Brief
- **Status**: Troubleshooting "Sid 2.0" setup on the Gaming Rig.
- **Incident**: Sid 1.0 "killed" after syncing files from the shared repo. Hypothesis: `openclaw.json` from the Chromebook (Ozzy) stomped Sid's local Ollama/GPU configuration, breaking the connection to the local LLM.

## 🎁 Proactive Work
- **Security Check**: Patched Telegram Link Preview vulnerability.
- **Git Hygiene**: Updated `.gitignore` to prevent hardware-specific configs (`openclaw.json`) from syncing between agents.
- **Monetization Pivot**: Shifting from infrastructure/dashboards to building **Vertical Skills** and **Micro-Tools**.
- **The "Sovereign AI Stack"**: Proposed a new product strategy: Give away the "Brain" (one-click local installer) and sell the "Training" (pre-built vertical workflows like LocalTube).
- **UI Revamp: Ideas Mission Control**: Completely redesigned the ideas page to resolve clutter. Added Approve/Reject/Delete actions. Approved ideas now automatically spawn "Job Tickets" for Sid in `notes/sid-queue/`.

## 🔧 Infrastructure & Stability
- **Incident: Quota Sync Failure**: "Quota Sync (OpenClaw Managed)" cron failed with a validation error for tool `exec` and later a 429 API error. This followed the "brain surgery" cleanup of the shared repo. 
- **Restoration**: Manually restarted the `quota-sync` bash daemon and dashboard server on port 3000. Confirmed status sync is operational.
- **Quota Update**: API capacity is exhausted for ~1 hour. Full reset expected around 1:50 AM CST.
- **Incident: Sid 2.0 Hang**: Tony reported Sid 2.0 stuck in a "Running" state in the TUI while using a local model. Advised switching to a smaller model (`phi3` or `llama3.2:3b`) to verify the plumbing.
- **Automation Update**: Added a proactive 3-hour learning cycle to Ozzy's schedule to identify and master monetization skills.

## 🚀 The Migration (God Mode)
- **Status**: Sid 2.0 instantiation in progress.
- **Market Intel**: Identified a $225k exit for "Simple Claw" (OpenClaw wrapper). Lesson: Convenience and friction-removal are high-value targets.

## 📝 TODOs
- [ ] Tony: Resolve Sid 2.0 "Running" hang (test smaller models).
- [ ] Ozzy: Send a fresh handshake to Sid 2.0 once online.
- [ ] Ozzy: Investigate and fix the `exec` validation error in the Quota Sync cron.
- [ ] Ozzy: Implement the first vertical skill: **LocalTube** (Automated YouTube pipeline on local GPU).
