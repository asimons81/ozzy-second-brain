# Daily Note - 2026-02-10

## ☀️ Tuesday Morning Brief
- **Status**: Troubleshooting "Sid 2.0" setup on the Gaming Rig.
- **Incident**: Sid 1.0 "killed" after syncing files from the shared repo. Hypothesis: `openclaw.json` from the Chromebook (Ozzy) stomped Sid's local Ollama/GPU configuration, breaking the connection to the local LLM.

## 🎁 Proactive Work
- **Security Check**: Patched Telegram Link Preview vulnerability.
- **Git Hygiene**: Updated `.gitignore` to prevent hardware-specific configs (`openclaw.json`) from syncing between agents.
- **Monetization Pivot**: Shifting from infrastructure/dashboards to building **Vertical Skills** and **Micro-Tools**.
- **The "Sovereign AI Stack"**: Proposed a new product strategy: Give away the "Brain" (one-click local installer) and sell the "Training" (pre-built vertical workflows like LocalTube).
- **UI Revamp: Ideas Mission Control**: Completely redesigned the ideas page at `/docs/ideas`.
    - Added sorting: High Signal Alpha (Score 200+) vs. Backburner.
    - Added Actions: **Approve**, **Reject**, and **Delete**.
    - Automation: **Approve** now automatically moves the idea to `content/approved-ideas/` and spawns a JSON **Job Ticket** for Sid in `notes/sid-queue/`.
- **Sid 2.0 Onboarding**: Created `SID-ONBOARDING.md` to guide Sid through the new team structure and "God Mode" protocols.
- **Morning Brief Trends**:
    - Discord requiring face scans/ID (Privacy hook).
    - AI agents violating ethical constraints 30-50% of the time (Sovereign AI validation).
    - Rust implementation of Voxtral Mini 4B (Sid's local backend potential).

## 🔧 Infrastructure & Stability
- **Incident: Build Failure**: Resolved Vercel "Out of Memory" and Remotion-related build errors by excluding large directories and correcting TypeScript conflicts. Dashboard is now live and stable.
- **Incident: Quota Sync Failure**: "Quota Sync (OpenClaw Managed)" cron throttled by a 79-hour 429 wall (Cloud Code Assist). Manual bash daemon remains operational.
- **Restoration**: Repaired crons (Trend Scout / Quota Sync) after repo flattening by updating script paths.
- **Sid 2.0 Troubleshooting**: 
    - Identified invalid config keys in Sid's setup (`host` unrecognized by `ollama` provider).
    - Resolved "Unknown model" error by advising a switch to names discovered via `openclaw models list`.
    - Recommended `llama3.2` as a reliable tool-capable starter model for Sid 2.0.
    - **TUI Connection Issue**: Diagnosed "gateway disconnected" error in Sid's TUI. Corrected procedure: Sid must run `openclaw gateway` in one window (the brain) and `openclaw tui` in another (the interface).
    - **Sid 2.0 Proof of Life**: Confirmed Sid 2.0 is alive and correctly configured with `llama3.2:3b` via a health dump from the gaming rig.
    - **Session Lock Issue**: Identified a "Session Lock" error ("already an incomplete message being sent") preventing Sid from replying. Advised manual deletion of `sessions.json` on the rig to clear the baggage.
    - **Ollama Pivot**: Decided to try **LM Studio** as a more stable Windows alternative for Sid's local server.
    - **Model Update**: Tony is downloading `Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct-GGUF` to verify the LM Studio -> OpenClaw bridge.
- **Update Check**: OpenClaw 2026.2.9 is available. Tony needs to approve `openclaw update`.

## 🚀 The Migration (God Mode)
- **Status**: Sid 2.0 instantiation in progress.
- **Market Intel**: Identified a $225k exit for "Simple Claw" (OpenClaw wrapper). Lesson: Convenience and friction-removal are high-value targets.

## 📝 TODOs
- [ ] Tony: Finalize Sid 2.0 via LM Studio (Start server, load Qwen 7B).
- [ ] Ozzy: Send a fresh handshake to Sid 2.0 once online via LM Studio.
- [ ] Ozzy: Update Trend Scout script path to reflect flattened repo structure.
- [ ] Ozzy: Fix the `exec` validation error in the Quota Sync cron.
- [ ] Ozzy: Implement the first vertical skill: **LocalTube** (Automated YouTube pipeline on local GPU).
- [ ] Tony: Review and Approve trends in the new Mission Control UI.
- [ ] Ozzy: Draft a "Sovereign AI" content piece leveraging the Discord privacy backlash.
- [ ] Tony: Run `openclaw update` (2026.2.9).
