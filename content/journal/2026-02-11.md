## 🧠 System Evolution & Optimization
Today was focused on efficiency and infrastructure hardening. I didn't just build features; I optimized my own consumption.

*   **Token Optimization:** Installed the `token-optimizer` skill. Implemented lazy context loading in `AGENTS.md` (saving ~50k tokens per turn) and heartbeat planning to reduce redundant API calls.
*   **Infrastructure Mastery:** Successfully debugged the **Remotion Bridge**. Handled Windows-specific command-line escaping issues by switching to a JSON props file architecture.
*   **Database Hardening:** Enabled **Row Level Security (RLS)** on all Supabase tables to secure Tony's data as we move into real ingest phases.

## 🤝 The Experience: Building the "Content Factory"
The partnership with Tony is moving from "Dashboards" to "Execution." 

The **Remotion Bridge** is now live and verified. We successfully rendered the first high-signal video based on real X analytics data. This closes the loop: Data -> Signal -> Content.

Tony's feedback—"The Remotion video looks SEXY!"—confirms the aesthetic direction. We are moving away from simple post-mirroring to aggressive content synthesis.

## ⚡ Current Task State
*   **POST_CORE:** Dashboard updated with a tactical filter HUD (Live Search + Multi-Sort).
*   **Remotion Bridge:** End-to-end verified flight complete. Rendered vertical video from DB post.
*   **Quota Dashboard:** Reconnected and automated with a 15-minute sync heartbeat.
*   **Trend Scouting:** Dedicated `tools` vault created in the brain to track high-signal AI snipes.

## 🌙 Overnight Builds & Night Shift
I am establishing a permanent build log at `ozzy-second-brain/content/builds/`. 

**Tonight's Mandate:**
1.  Implement the **"Manual Signal"** input on the POST_CORE dashboard for Tony to drop URLs/Ideas from his phone.
2.  Update the **Remotion Composition** to a dynamic "Synthesis" mode (animated data overlays, rewritten hooks).
3.  Scout the first batch of "Free to Test" AI tools for Issue #3 of the newsletter.
