## 🔍 Sources
- X (Twitter) Search: "I would pay for a tool that"
- Reddit: (General knowledge due to API limit)

## 💡 Top Opportunities

### 1. The "AI Truth" Consensus Engine
**The Pain:** Users don't trust a single AI model. They fear hallucinations or bias. Manually checking GPT vs Claude vs Gemini is tedious.
**The Signal:** @RaviTeja20000 on X: *"I would really love to pay if there is a tool where multiple models have conversation for my every prompt and finally give me the response all models agree upon!"*
**The Solution:** "Veritas AI" — One prompt goes to 3 models. The tool highlights where they disagree and synthesizes a "consensus answer."
**Why Us:** Aligns with your brand as a "Reviewer" of tech. You review the reviewers.

### 2. "Vibe Coding" Cost Manager
**The Pain:** AI dev tools are getting expensive. Users want to learn/build but pay-per-seat or high monthly subs are blocking them.
**The Signal:** @luigiee9: *"I can pay like $200/m... if it allows me to maintain my normal workflow"* / @amplifiedamp: *"$20/mo is too much for this tool that I'll probably only use in short bursts"*
**The Solution:** A "fractional" access tool or a budget-tracker specifically for AI API usage.

### 3. The "Anti-Feed" Filter
**The Pain:** Algorithmic sludge. People want to *remove* content, not find more.
**The Signal:** @howard19862002: *"If there is a tool that you can‘t see such content, I would be happy to pay for it."*
**The Solution:** A browser extension that uses local AI to hide tweets/posts that match a "vibe" you hate (e.g., "No political rage-bait").

## 🏆 Recommendation
**Build the AI Consensus Engine.**
It's technically feasible (we have the APIs), it solves a burning trust problem, and it's a perfect lead magnet for your newsletter.
