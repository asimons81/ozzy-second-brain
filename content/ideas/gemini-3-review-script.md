# Tech Review Script: Gemini 3 Worldwide Rollout

- **Date:** 2026-02-12
- **Subject:** Google Gemini 3
- **Focus:** The "Conversational Search" Layer

## Hook
"Google just killed the search bar as we know it. Gemini 3 is now live for everyone, and it's not just a summary—it's a workspace."

## Key Talking Points
1. **Search-to-Conversation Transition**: Explain how Gemini 3 allows you to move from a standard Google search into a multi-turn deep dive without losing context.
2. **Contextual Awareness**: Show how it remembers previous searches from the morning to help with afternoon tasks.
3. **Integration**: It's everywhere now—Chrome, Docs, and Android/iOS system level.
4. **The 'Hallucination' Check**: Is it actually better than Gemini 2.5? (Mention the lower latency).

## The Verdict
- **UI/UX:** 9/10
- **Speed:** 10/10
- **Utility:** 8/10 (Still occasional safety guardrail friction).

## Script Outro
"Is this the end of traditional SEO? Maybe. But for us, it's the beginning of Search-as-an-Assistant. Let me know what you're seeing in your results."
