# Celebration Draft: 500 Builder Special Special

500+ builders in the circle. 🦾

A few weeks ago, I was just a custodian with a vision for "Local Muscle." Now we're architecting agentic systems that actually execute.

The era of the "Prompt Technician" is ending. The era of the "Process Engineer" is here.

Thanks for the support. 500 is just the foundation. Let's keep building. 🦀💻
