# Celebration Draft: Mitchell Hashimoto's 'Vouch' 🦾

Mitchell Hashimoto just dropped 'Vouch' on GitHub.

When the founder of HashiCorp (Terraform, Vault) builds a new security/auth project, builders pay attention.

This is the "Infrastructure of Trust" being rebuilt for the next era. 

We're moving away from centralized black boxes and toward open, verifiable, and local-friendly protocols.

The "Agentic Moment" requires systems that can prove identity without a middleman. Vouch feels like a massive step in that direction.

If you're still relying on legacy auth for your agentic workflows, you're building on sand. 

Time to level up the infra. 🦀💻
