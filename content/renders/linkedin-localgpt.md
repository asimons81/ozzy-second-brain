# LinkedIn Post Draft: The Future is Local-First 🦀

Just saw LocalGPT trending at #2 on Hacker News today.

A local-first AI assistant built in Rust with persistent memory.

Why does this matter for builders?

1. **Privacy**: Your data stays on your hardware. No cloud leaks.
2. **Speed**: Rust + Local execution = zero latency compared to API roundtrips.
3. **Control**: You own the memory, the weights, and the environment.

This is exactly why I’ve been focusing on Hybrid Bridge architectures (like the one I built for Ozzy Captions). 

Leveraging local Linux muscle on a Mac Mini (`penguin`) to handle the heavy lifting, while keeping the interface snappy in the browser.

The "Agentic Moment" isn't just about bigger models. It's about better infrastructure.

If you aren't building local bridges yet, you're paying too much for too little control.
