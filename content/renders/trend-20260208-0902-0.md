## Core Thesis
> AI

---

### ❌✅ Contrast

❌ Spending 4 hours writing a draft
✅ Prompting a base in 30 seconds

❌ Manual data entry into spreadsheets
✅ Automated scraping with AI agents

❌ Hiring a generic agency for $5k
✅ Building a custom GPT for $20

AI isn't replacing you. The person using it is.

### 📈 Milestone

0 to 14,830 weekly views in 42 days.

No paid ads.
No engagement pods.

Just 1 hour of Claude prompting every morning.
I focused on iterating based on the data.

### ⚖️ Symmetric

2024 Workflow vs 2026 Workflow

Manual research | Neural search
Drafting outlines | Instant skeletons
Stock images | Custom visuals
Human editing | Human curation
Email chains | Autonomous agents

### 📋 List

1. **Context Window**: Feed the model your brand history for better tone.
2. **Few-Shot Prompting**: Provide 3 examples to get the exact output.
3. **Chain of Thought**: Ask the AI to reason step-by-step to avoid errors.
4. **System Instructions**: Set a permanent persona to keep responses consistent.
5. **Recursive Feedback**: Feed the output back in for a second polish.

### 💥 Split Hook

Most people think AI is a search engine.

It is actually a tireless intern with a PhD in everything.

### 🔥 Raw & Real

if you aren't using ai to automate your boring tasks you're gonna fall behind faster than you think. tools like perplexity are free. use them.

### 🎭 Amateur vs Pro

The Amateur: Blames the AI for bad results.

The Pro: Refines the prompt until the output is perfect.

Output quality is a mirror of your input clarity.
Bad prompts lead to generic garbage.
Master the bridge between thought and machine.

### 🔺 Triad

Master prompt engineering.
Automate repetitive workflows.
Buy back 20 hours every week.

---

### ⚡ Extremes

The single biggest mistake is treating AI like a magic button.

Hard truth: AI doesn't fix a broken business model. It only scales what already works.

Stop looking for a shortcut. Use AI to amplify your existing expertise instead of replacing it.

### 🎯 Callout

Popular opinion: AI will replace all creative writers by next year.

My opinion: AI will only replace the average ones.

Great writing requires taste and lived experience. AI provides the clay, but you still have to be the sculptor. Use the tool to build the frame, then add the soul yourself.
