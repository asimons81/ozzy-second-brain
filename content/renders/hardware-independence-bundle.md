# 🚀 Hardware Independence Bundle

**Thesis:** I'm replacing my $17/hr custodian job by earning $1,200 for an M4 Mac Mini through agentic products. Build in public or die trying.

## 💼 LinkedIn Post

I’m done trading my nights to clean buildings for $17/hr.

For the last few years, I’ve been working a second job as a custodian to support my family. It’s honest work, but it takes me away from what matters most: being home with my kids.

Today, I’m launching **Operation Hardware Independence**.

The goal: Earn $1,200 by April 1st to buy an M4 Mac Mini (32GB RAM).
The reason: My current 6.5GB RAM Chromebook is a bottleneck for the AI agents I’m building. To go faster, I need more muscle.

I’m building this in public using three revenue streams:
1. **The Tool Takedown**: My newsletter with raw agentic templates.
2. **Ozzy Captions**: A local-first alternative to expensive caption tools.
3. **NOVA**: My video agent service for high-signal explainers.

I’m not looking for a handout. I’m looking for leverage. I’m trading my mop for a compiler.

Watch me build it, or join the list to get the tools I use to escape the grind.

If I can replace a custodian's income with AI agents on a 6GB Chromebook, you have no excuses. Here is the raw plan for the Tool Takedown Inner Circle.
