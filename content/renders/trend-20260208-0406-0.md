### 💥 Split Hook

Your digital footprint isn't just a trail of where you've been...

It is a map that companies use to predict where you will go next.

### 🔥 Raw & Real

most people gonna wait until their identity is stolen to care about encryption.

Don't be the person who values locks only after the house is empty. Privacy is an active choice.

### 🎭 Amateur vs Pro

The Amateur: Thinks privacy is about having secrets.

The Pro: Knows privacy is about having power.

If you don't control your data, someone else will use it against you. It is the ultimate form of digital leverage.

### ⚡ Extremes

The single biggest mistake you are making is using "Sign in with Google" for every app.

Hard Truth: You are building a single point of failure for your entire digital life. One hack ruins everything.

Switch to unique emails and strong passwords for every account. It takes 5 minutes of effort for 100% more security.

### 🎯 Callout

Popular opinion: If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.

My opinion: Having nothing to hide is not a reason to give up your right to be left alone.

You close the door when you go to the bathroom. You have curtains on your windows. Privacy is a fundamental human need, not a criminal's tool.
