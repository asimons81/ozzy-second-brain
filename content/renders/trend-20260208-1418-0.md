### 📋 List

1. **Leverage Failures**: Use your past mistakes as a filter for what actually works.
2. **Niche Hobbies**: Connect unrelated interests to create a perspective nobody else has.
3. **Local Insights**: Use your specific geography to solve problems global players miss.
4. **Personal Stacking**: Combine three average skills to become world-class in your lane.
5. **Public Building**: Share the messy process to attract a tribe of true believers.

### 💥 Split Hook

Most people spend years trying to hide their weirdness.

The top 1% spend those years turning it into a monopoly.

---

### 🔥 Raw & Real

everyone is tryna be a carbon copy of their idols.

Stop.

Your failures are the only thing they can't copy.
Stack your scars instead of hiding them.

---

### 🎭 Amateur vs Pro

The Amateur: Tries to master every skill to look perfect.

The Pro: Stacks their failures and weird hobbies to build a monopoly.

Amateurs fear judgment from the crowd.
Pros know the crowd is where generic ideas go to die.
Value lives in the intersection of your specific traits.

---

### 🔺 Triad

Document your failures.
Stack your hobbies.
Build a personal monopoly.

---

### ⚡ Extremes

The #1 fastest way to become replaceable is to follow the standard path.

Hard truth: Your degree is a commodity.

The market doesn't pay for what everyone knows. It pays for the specific insight gained from your unique mess.

Audit your life for the things you're embarrassed to share.
That's where your real edge is hidden.

---

### 🎯 Callout

Popular opinion: You need to be the best at one specific skill.

My opinion: You need to be the only one with your specific stack.

Being the best is a race to the bottom on price.
Being the only one allows you to set the terms.

Combine your love for 90s anime, data science, and living in rural Ohio.
That's a moat nobody can jump.
