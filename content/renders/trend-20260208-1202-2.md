## Core Thesis
> Modern gaming’s

---

### ❌✅ Contrast

Gaming then vs Gaming now:

❌ Battle passes and FOMO
❌ Pre-order for 'early' access
❌ 100GB day-one patches
✅ Full games on the disc
✅ Unlocking skins through skill
✅ Local split-screen play

Priority shifted from fun to finance.

---

### 📈 Milestone

0 to 874 players in 14 days.

No marketing budget.
No predatory loot boxes.
Just a core loop that actually works.

Build for the player first.

### ⚖️ Symmetric

2004 Gaming | 2024 Gaming

Complete code | Beta testing
Cheat codes | Credit cards
Secret levels | DLC bundles
Physical copy | License only
Pure soul | Data driven

---

### 📋 List

1. **Mechanical Depth**: Prioritize how the game feels over how it looks.
2. **Player Agency**: Stop using hand-holding tutorials that last five hours.
3. **Optimized Code**: Performance is a feature, not an afterthought.
4. **Respectful Monetization**: Selling skins is fine, selling power is a death sentence.
5. **Organic Discovery**: Let players find secrets without a map marker.

### 💥 Split Hook

Modern studios aren't competing for your enjoyment anymore.

They're competing for your screen time and your psychological triggers.

---

### 🔥 Raw & Real

everybody is gonna act surprised when the next 'live service' titan flops. we stopped making games and started making digital malls.

---

### 🎭 Amateur vs Pro

The Amateur: Builds a game around a monetization strategy.

The Pro: Builds a game around a unique mechanical hook.

One creates a temporary spike in revenue.
The other creates a decade of loyal fans.

---

### 🔺 Triad

Delete map markers.
Remove microtransactions.
Restore the wonder.

---

### ⚡ Extremes

The single biggest mistake in modern game dev is 'Design by Committee'.

When you try to please every demographic, you end up with a bland product that excites nobody.

Pick a niche. Polarize the audience. Build something with a soul.

---

### 🎯 Callout

Popular opinion: Games need 100+ hours of content to be worth $70.

My opinion: A tight 10-hour experience is worth more than a bloated 100-hour checklist.

Quality beats quantity every time.
Stop valuing games by the hour.
