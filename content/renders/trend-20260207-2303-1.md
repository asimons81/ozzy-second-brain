## Core Thesis
> Agentic coding kills

---

### ❌✅ Contrast

❌ Relying on agents to design architecture
✅ Using agents for boilerplate patterns

❌ Accepting code without manual review
✅ Verifying every logic gate personally

❌ Replacing knowledge with AI prompts
✅ Scaling expertise with agentic tools

---

### 📈 Milestone

0 to 14,320 lines of production code in 19 days.

No manual syntax debugging. Just high-level system design.

I spent 82% of my time reviewing and 18% prompting.

---

### ⚖️ Symmetric

2023 vs 2025

Writing syntax | Prompt engineering
Manual debugging | Code verification
Logic puzzles | System architecture
Stack Overflow | Agent orchestration
Junior roles | Architect roles

---

### 📋 List

1. **Logic Erosion**: Developers stop understanding the why behind their functions.
2. **Technical Debt**: Agents prioritize speed over long-term maintainability.
3. **Review Fatigue**: Checking 500 lines of AI code is harder than writing 50.
4. **Skill Stagnation**: Juniors never learn the struggle that builds mastery.
5. **Security Gaps**: Automated agents often overlook subtle edge-case vulnerabilities.

---

### 💥 Split Hook

Most developers think agentic coding is a shortcut to seniority.

In reality, it is the fastest way to become a high-speed liability.

---

### 🔥 Raw & Real

everyone is gonna let agents write their whole repo this year.

they won't realize the technical debt is eating their margins until the first major bug hits.

don't be the dev who forgets how to read code.

---

### 🎭 Amateur vs Pro

The Amateur: Lets the agent drive the architecture and hopes it works.

The Pro: Uses the agent as a high-speed intern while maintaining strict veto power.

The difference is ownership.
One builds a house of cards. The other builds a fortress at 10x speed.

---

### 🔺 Triad

Master the fundamentals.
Orchestrate autonomous agents.
Ship features at terminal velocity.

---

### ⚡ Extremes

The #1 fastest way to destroy your codebase is trusting autonomous agents.

AI is a world-class producer but a terrible architect. If you can't explain every line the agent wrote, you don't own the product.

Stop prompting and start auditing.

---

### 🎯 Callout

Popular opinion: Agentic coding will replace software engineers by 2026.

My opinion: It will only replace the engineers who act like agents.

The value shifts from how to write to what to build. Thinking becomes the only moat left.
