Then I saw how fast \"essential\" roles disappear when the market shifts. \n\nI realized that the only true security comes from owning the systems of production. I shifted my focus from climbing to building. By creating a digital leverage system, I stopped trading my life for a salary and started building assets that work 24/7. \n\nHere are 3 key shifts you can make today:\n\n- Build assets that do not require your physical presence. Think products or content.\n- Prioritize equity and ownership over a fixed salary.\n- Focus on high-leverage tasks that compound over time instead of one-off tasks.\n\nAre you building your own dream or are you just a line item in someone else's spreadsheet?\n\n#DigitalLeverage #Entrepreneurship #CareerGrowth",
