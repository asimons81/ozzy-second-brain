    "linkedin_post": "I spent 10 years believing that scaling meant hiring more people. \n\nI was wrong. \n\nScaling now means building systems that think for themselves. Last month, I replaced a 5-step manual data entry process with a single agentic workflow. The transition wasn't about finding a smarter bot. It was about creating a recursive loop where the AI critiques its own output before I ever see it. \n\nThis shift moves you from being a micro-manager of AI to being a system architect. \n\nKey takeaways for your first agent:\n- Define the objective, not the individual steps.\n- Connect the AI to your live data via APIs.\n- Set up a reflection step where the agent checks for logic errors.\n\nThe shift from Chat to Agent is the biggest leverage jump of the decade. \n\nAre you still babysitting your AI, or is it working for you?\n\n#Automation #Efficiency #Workflows",
    "newsletter_blurb": "Subject: The death of the prompt engineer.\n\nMost people are still stuck in the Chat era of AI. They type a prompt, get a result, and repeat. It is slow and unscalable. The real money is moving toward agentic systems that run while you sleep. I broke down the 3 specific loops that saved me 15 hours last week. \n\nRead the full takedown here ->"
