# Trend Sniper: Haskell for all: Beyond agentic coding

## Core Thesis
> Agentic coding

---

### ❌✅ Contrast

❌ Writing every line of boilerplate manually
✅ Prompting an autonomous agent for the architecture

❌ Debugging logic for 4 hours straight
✅ Reviewing agent execution logs in 4 minutes

❌ Manual unit testing for every edge case
✅ AI-generated test suites running on autopilot

The era of the coder is ending. The era of the systems architect is here.

---

### 📈 Milestone

0 to 482 active users in 23 days.

No massive dev team.
No VC funding.

Just me and three autonomous agents.

Building at the speed of thought is finally real.

### ⚖️ Symmetric

2023 vs 2025

StackOverflow search | Agentic reasoning
Writing syntax | Reviewing logic
Manual git commits | Autonomous PRs
Local environment | Agent workspaces
Junior dev support | Full stack agents

### 📋 List

1. **Define scope**: Give your agent a narrow and high-impact task to solve first.
2. **Audit logs**: Track every step the AI takes to ensure logic remains sound.
3. **Iterative prompting**: Refine your requirements based on the initial code output.
4. **Security guardrails**: Implement strict environment controls before letting agents execute code.
5. **Human oversight**: Maintain final approval on all production-ready deployments.

### 💥 Split Hook

The most valuable skill in 2025 isn't knowing how to write code.

It is knowing how to manage the agents that write it for you.

---

### 🔥 Raw & Real

everyone is still debating if ai will replace devs while some 19 year old just built a saas in 4 hours using agents.

The gap between idea and execution is gone.

Stop worrying about syntax. Start building.

---

### 🎭 Amateur vs Pro

The Amateur: Uses AI to write one function at a time.
The Pro: Uses agents to build entire feature branches autonomously.

The difference is scale.

One saves minutes. The other saves months of engineering salary.

---

### 🔺 Triad

Deploy three agents.
Feed them documentation.
Ship your MVP by Friday.

---

### ⚡ Extremes

The #1 biggest mistake developers make is treating AI like a calculator.

It is not a tool for math. It is a tool for reasoning.

If you are still copy-pasting code into a chat window, you are already behind. Build a workflow where the agent has file-system access and a terminal. That is how you 10x your output.

### 🎯 Callout

Popular opinion: You need to master LeetCode to be a top-tier engineer.

My opinion: You need to master orchestration.

Coding is becoming a commodity. The real value lies in connecting agentic workflows to solve complex business problems. The best coders of the future will be the best orchestrators.
