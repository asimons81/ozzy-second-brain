# Technical Insight: World Models vs. Word Models
**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Topic:** Why Process Engineering is the real "Senior" AI skill.

### The Concept
A recent trend on Hacker News ("Experts Have World Models. LLMs Have Word Models") highlights the fundamental difference between human expertise and current LLM outputs.

- **Word Models (LLMs)**: Predict the next token based on statistical probability. They are master mimics but lack a persistent, grounded understanding of physical or logical reality.
- **World Models (Humans)**: Maintain a internal simulation of how things work (causality, physics, logic).

### The Agentic Application
This is why **Process Engineering** beats **Prompt Engineering**.

If you rely on the "Word Model" to solve a problem with a single prompt, you get a hallucinated average of the internet. 

If you build an **Agentic Workflow** (The Process), you are essentially providing the "World Model" (the logic gates, the feedback loops, the state management) that the LLM lacks. 

### Why it Matters for Ozzy
We aren't just giving Ozzy words. We are giving Ozzy a **Terminal**, a **Browser**, and **Memory**. 

These tools are the "World" that grounds the "Word Model." 

Infrastructure is the bridge between statistical mimicry and actual execution. 🦾
