## Core Thesis
> Agentic coding

---

### ❌✅ Contrast

Old coding vs Agentic coding

❌ Manual syntax debugging
✅ AI-driven error correction

❌ Writing boilerplate code
✅ High-level logic prompts

❌ Context switching for docs
✅ In-flow context retrieval

❌ 10 hours for a feature
✅ 42 minutes for a feature

---

### 📈 Milestone

0 to 142 beta users in 19 days.

No bloated dev team.
No manual unit tests.

I just used 3 agentic loops and 87 prompts.

Efficiency is the new scale.

### ⚖️ Symmetric

2024 coding:                2026 coding:
- Writing syntax          - Designing logic
- Fixing typos             - Reviewing agents
- Manual testing          - Autonomous QA
- Copying Stack          - Instant generation
- Slow deployment      - Continuous flow

---

### 📋 List

1. **Context injection**: Give agents deep access to your codebase.
2. **Feedback loops**: Let the agent run code and fix its own errors.
3. **Modular prompting**: Break complex features into 5-minute subtasks.
4. **Human review**: Shift from writing code to auditing logic.
5. **Tool integration**: Connect agents to your terminal and browser.

### 💥 Split Hook

The developer who writes every line of code by hand
Will soon be managed by the one who orchestrates agents.

---

### 🔥 Raw & Real

everyone gonna keep arguing about which language is better.

Meanwhile the top 1% are building agentic workflows that write the code for them.

Focus on the system. Not the syntax.

---

### 🎭 Amateur vs Pro

The Amateur: Asks AI to write a single function and gives up when it fails.

The Pro: Builds a recursive loop where the agent tests and refines its own output.

Success isn't about the first prompt.
It is about the architecture of the feedback loop.

---

### 🔺 Triad

Deploy autonomous agents.
Automate repetitive refactoring.
Ship features 10x faster.

---

### ⚡ Extremes

The #1 mistake devs make is treating AI like a calculator.

It is not a tool for snippets. It is a junior developer waiting for a process.

Stop prompting for code. Start building environments where agents can think and execute.

---

### 🎯 Callout

Popular opinion: AI will replace junior developers.

My opinion: AI will turn every junior into a senior architect.

Code becomes a commodity. Logic becomes the leverage.

The value shifts from knowing how to write code to knowing what to build.
