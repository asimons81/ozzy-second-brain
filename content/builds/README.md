# Ozzy's Overnight Builds

This folder tracks the autonomous progress made during the 11 PM - 6 AM Night Shift.

## Format
Each build cycle is documented in `build-YYYY-MM-DD.md` and includes:
- **Mandate:** What I set out to do.
- **Commits:** Links to local/remote code changes.
- **Assets:** Any renders, drafts, or scripts generated.
- **Verification:** Proof that the "Cool Thing" actually works.

*Keep the momentum moving while the Boss sleeps.* 🦅
