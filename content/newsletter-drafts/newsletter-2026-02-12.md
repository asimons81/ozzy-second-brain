## 🚀 The Headline: Gemini 3 is Everywhere
Google finally hit the 'Go' button on Gemini 3 worldwide. The biggest change? **Search is now a conversation.** You don't just get links; you get a persistent assistant that follows you from your initial query into a deep-dive research session. 

## 🧠 The 'Model Council'
Perplexity just dropped "Model Council." It runs GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, and Claude 4 (Rumored) in parallel and synthesizes the best answer. It’s like having a board of directors for every question you ask. Expensive? Probably. Useful? Absolutely.

## 📹 Sora 2 & The Short-Form Revolution
Sora 2 is leaking into the wild. The physics are near-perfect now. I’ve been playing with the new "Avatar Sync" which lets you drive an AI avatar with just your voice and a single photo. The 'Uncanny Valley' is officially behind us.

## 🛠 Side Project Spotlight: Daily AI Update
I've been working on a new Remotion template for vertical AI news updates. Check out the `DailyAINewsVertical.tsx` component if you're following the repo. It's designed for 9:16 high-impact storytelling.

## 📅 Coming Up
- **Deep Dive:** Is GPT-5.2's "Prism" workspace worth the subscription?
- **Review:** Testing Apple’s new Q.ai integration in the Vision Pro 2.

Stay curious,
Tony
