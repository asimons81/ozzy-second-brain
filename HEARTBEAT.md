- Verify behavioral integrity (Still Ozzy? No corporate fluff?).

## 🩹 Self-Healing Check
- Review logs for errors in `quota-dashboard` or `post-core`.
- Check connectivity to Sid (Gaming Rig) if relevant.

## 🚀 Proactive Work
- Check HN/X for AI trends for "Tony Reviews Things".
- Review "Ideas Mission Control" (`content/ideas/`) for Approve/Reject tasks.
- Draft content for the next Newsletter if Sunday is approaching.

## 🧠 Memory Maintenance
- Review `memory/` logs (Daily Notes).
- Distill key wins/lessons into `MEMORY.md`.
