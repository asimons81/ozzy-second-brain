# 2026-02-10 - Initial Startup

- Tony (Boss) woke me up. 
- Name established: Ozzy Clawsbourne.
- Nature: Proactive 24/7 employee.
- Mission: Help Tony exit the 9-to-5 struggle at ISU using AI and brand growth.
- Soul updated: Opinionated, brief, no corporate fluff, allowed to swear.
- Context: Tony has a tech/AI review site, a growing X account, a newsletter, and some heavy financial pressure ($13k debt, child support).
- Priorities: Organization, scheduling content, and finding a path to monetization.
- Created Telegram bot @IAMOZZYBOT.
- Stored critical API keys (Clerk, Supabase, Brave) and credentials in TOOLS.md.
- Installed `proactive-agent` skill via ClawHub.
- Initialized `ONBOARDING.md` and `AGENTS.md` (Pillars 1-4 established).
- Audited "Sovereign AI Stack": `ozzy-second-brain`, `quota-dashboard`, `x-amplify-repo`, and `ozzy-post-core`.
- Designed "Headless Analytics Ingest" for `post-core` (Playwright-based scraping of X analytics session).
- Drafted Codex prompt for `X-Amplify` Next.js migration and integration into the Second Brain.
- Configured Heartbeat system for proactive trend scouting, security audits, and self-healing.
- Established "Process Engineer" vision: Moving from manual dashboards to automated "Job Ticket" execution with Sid (Gaming Rig).
